# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Final Project

## Theme
it was hard to choose, but i ultamately decided that the main characters needed to go through a long quest to get the ONE BUTTON they did'nt have in their button collection

## Game Play
Objective
get the button
Game-play instructions
its a visual novel, so just read along and make your choices with the buttons below

## What did you 
Struggles or surprises you encountered during the development of the game
the main struggle was the animations as i don't really know how to change them given differing inky prompts
otherwise i just had some simple type errors, like needing to change images to sprites and so forth

## Special Focus
What is your special focus? What did you do for it? How would you rate your own effort? 1-5. (I will agree or disagree with this sentiment, but I want to know what you thought)
my focus was mainly design and art, id rate my effort a 5, i for one made the music from scratch (which has two different instrument), then i added a background, finally i added the animations which were the most time consuming as they required me to take several greenscreened photo's in vrchat, then photo edit to get the base sprites, then finall add all the animations
